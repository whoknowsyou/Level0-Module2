		// 1. Make a main method and make sure your program can run

		// 2. Make a String variable to hold the value of Pi.
		//    Get the first few digits from http://www.piday.org/million/.

		// 3. Print out the first 3 digits of Pi to the console.
		//    The first value is "pi.charAt(0)", the second is "pi.charAt(1)", etc.
		//    Run your program to see how this works.

		// 9. If you want to give the user more than one chance to guess,
		//    put a for loop around steps 4-8.

			// 4. Create a for loop that will step through each digit of pi (steps 5-8)
			//    NOTE: The number of digits in your string will be
			//       yourStringVariable.length()

				// 5. Ask the user for the NEXT digit of pi.

				// 6. Compare the user's input to the next digit of your pi variable 
				//    (look at step 3 for a clue).
				//    HINT: use charAt(0) to get 1st char of user input String 

					// 7. If they are correct, print out "correct".

					// 8. If they are not, print out "incorrect" and tell them
					//    to start over. Use 'break;' to break out of the loop.
